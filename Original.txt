welcome to today's weather forecast, today in the morning when the sun rises the hot sunny beam hits my skin and emits a warm feeling. at 12 PM the temperature of the air changes and it starts to rain. at 2 AM the temperature goes below freezing like how the weather would feel like if it were snowing and, the sun no longer emits a warm, infrared light because the clouds block the sun and the stars luminate.
